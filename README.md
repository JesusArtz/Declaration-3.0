# Declaration-3.0
This small project that includes Html, Css and JavaScript has the only function of making a declaration of love to your crush, the only thing it does is that when she positions her cursor on the "No" button she moves and just doesn't let her click. 

In version 2.0 only one difference was added with the previous one, and that is that it is much more beautiful, since it contains animations in the buttons.

In this current version, probably final version, animations were added in the background,
Likewise, a main page was created in which it redirects you to the page you want, in this case a page to declare yourself to a boy, or on the contrary, to declare yourself to a girl, on the main page you will also find a donation button , which are optional and motivate me to continue creating projects of this style.
